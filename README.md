This project seeks to determine the effect of eating a meal at home vs away from home on sodium consumed at that meal, and seeks to untangle the interaction effects of day type (weekend vs weekday) and meal source (premade food vs non-premade food) on that effect.

A detailed discussion of the motivation, methods, and results for this project can be found in the final_project_writeup document. The raw data comprises DR1IFF.xpt and DR2IFF.xpt, with WWEIA1516_foodcat_FNDDS.xlsx included as a reference for looking up full descriptions of foods that correspond to the food codes given in the raw data. The code for the actual project is in final_project_did.R.
